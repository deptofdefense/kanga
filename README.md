# Kanga

## Description

Kanga is an open source Python application for sending messages to SMS and [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) targets using the [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) API.

For information about the Twilio Python library see [The Twilio Python Helper Library](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python).

## Development

Kanga is built on the widely used [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework, so the development workflow should be familiar to most Django developers.

### Setup

The first step to develop the application is to create a Python virtual environment.  You can use the following commands to create the virtual environment using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), activate the environment, install all the required dependencies, and install the application as editable.

Run these commands individually.

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install build
pip install flake8
pip install wheel
pip install -e .
```

If using `macOS` install these dependencies if they are missing:

```shell
brew install awscli chamber circleci direnv jq libpq python@3.9
```

See `.envrc.local.template` for instructions on setting up local environment variables.

### Basic Workflow

First, build the database container using:

```shell
make docker_build_db
```

Second, build the application container using:

```shell
make docker_build_app
```

Next, start the database in the background using:

```shell
make docker_start_db
```

To reset the application run:

```sh
# if the virtual environment is not active, then activate it
source .venv/bin/activate
make reset
```

To launch the server run:

```sh
# if the virtual environment is not active, then activate it
source .venv/bin/activate
make runserver
```

### Using Docker Compose

You can use docker compose to test the application using HTTPS and client certificates.

Using docker compose requires the "web" container, which can be built using:

```shell
make docker_build_web
```

Add the following to `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 kangalocal
```

Create the certificate authority, server key pair, and client key pair.

```shell
make temp/ca.crt temp/server.crt temp/DoDRoots.crt temp/client.p12
```

Then launch the docker cluster using:

```shell
make up
```

Then, collect the Django static files in Docker using:

```shell
make docker_run_collectstatic
````

### Migrations

To build migrations for changes to database models use the following.

```
make migrations
```

To apply migrations use the following.

```
make migrate
```

## Deployment

### Production

These are the current steps:

```sh
ssh kanga
cd /home/ubuntu/kanga
git pull
make docker_build_app docker_build_web
make sync-secrets-vars
source app-kanga-prod.vars
make up-prod
make prod-collectstatic
```
